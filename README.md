# Automation with Selenium Java with Cucumber and Frameworks

## What is Software Testing?
• Software testing is an activity to check whether the actual results match the 
expected results and to ensure that the software system is Defect free. 
• Software testing also helps to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements in 
contrary to the actual requirements. 
• It can be either done manually or using automated tools.

## What is selenium?
• Selenium is a free (open source) automated testing suite for web applications across different browsers and platforms.
• Testing done using Selenium tool is usually referred as Selenium Testing.
• Selenium is not just a single tool but a suite of software's.
• It has four components:
   Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
   Selenium Remote Control (RC)
   WebDriver
   Selenium Grid

 ## Advantages of Selenium
• Selenium is pure open source tool.
• Selenium supports variety of languages that include Java, Perl, Python, C#, Ruby, Groovy, Java Script, and VB Script. etc.
• Selenium supports many operating systems like Windows, Macintosh, Linux, Unix etc.
• Selenium supports many browsers like Internet explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari etc.
• Selenium can be integrated with Jenkins or Hudson for continuous integration.
• Selenium can be integrated with other open source tools for supporting other features.
• Selenium can be used for Android, IPhone, Blackberry etc. based application testing.

## Disadvantages of Selenium
• We can use Selenium only to test web applications. We cannot test desktop applications.

## Selenium Suite
• Selenium IDE, a Firefox and Chrome add-on that you can only use in creating relatively simple test cases and test suites.
• Selenium Remote Control, also known as Selenium 1, which is the first Selenium 
tool that allowed users to use programming languages in creating complex tests.
• WebDriver, the newer breakthrough that allows your test scripts to communicate directly to the browser.
• Selenium Grid is also a tool that is used to execute parallel tests across different browsers and operating systems remotely.
• Selenium RC and WebDriver was merged to form Selenium 2.
